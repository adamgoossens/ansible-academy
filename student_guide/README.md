# Ansible Academy Workshop

Welcome to the workshop! This workshop is a simple hands-on introduction to Ansible Automation Platform. You don't need to be fluent in writing Ansible to
take part - in fact, you don't need to write any Ansible automation **at all** throughout this workshop.

There are multiple labs below. Complete each one in sequence. They are small and designed to be very quick to complete.
